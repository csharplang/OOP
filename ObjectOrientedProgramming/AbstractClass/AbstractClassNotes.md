## Abstract Class
* An abstract class is an incomplete class or special class we <b>can't instantiate.</b> 
* We can use an abstract class as a base Class. 
* An abstract method must be implemented in the non-abstract class using the override keyword. 
* After overriding the abstract method is in the non-Abstract class. 
* We can derive this class in another class and again we can override the same abstract method with it.
