## Interface
* An interface is like an abstract base class.
Any class or struct that implements the interface must implement all its members.
* An interface can't be instantiated directly. 
* Its members are implemented by any class or struct that implements the interface.
Interfaces can contain events, indexers, methods, and properties.
* Interfaces contain no implementation of methods.
* A class or struct can implement multiple interfaces. 
A class can inherit a base class and also implement one or more interfaces.
