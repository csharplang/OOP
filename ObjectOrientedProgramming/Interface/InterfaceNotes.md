Interfaces are used along with classes to define what is known as a contract. 
A contract is an agreement on what the class will provide to an application.

An interface looks like a class, but has no implementation. 
The only thing it contains are declarations of events, indexers, methods and/or properties.




## Interface
* An interface is like an abstract base class.
Any class or struct that implements the interface must implement all its members.
* An interface can't be instantiated directly. 
* Its members are implemented by any class or struct that implements the interface.
Interfaces can contain events, indexers, methods, and properties.
* Interfaces contain no implementation of methods.
* A class or struct can implement multiple interfaces. 
A class can inherit a base class and also implement one or more interfaces.
